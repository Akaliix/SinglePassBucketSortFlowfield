# Flowfield Benchmark: Comparing Pathfinding Algorithms in C# 


## Overview 


This project benchmarks three flow field pathfinding algorithms implemented in C#:

 
- **Dijkstra-Based Flow Field (Priority Queue)**
 
- **Bucket-Based Flow Field (Modular Queue)**
 
- **Queue-Based Flow Field (Simple FIFO Queue)**


The goal is to evaluate the computational efficiency, memory usage, and scalability of each method across a range of grid sizes and obstacle densities. All implementations support 8-directional movement and variable terrain costs.

## Features 

 
- âœ… Benchmarks on grids from `128x128` up to `4096x4096`
 
- âœ… Performance evaluation in 3 distinct scenarios:

 
  - No Obstacles
 
  - Concentric Wall Rings
 
  - 50% Random Wall Density
 
- âœ… Metrics:

 
  - Per-cell execution time (Î¼s/cell)
 
  - Per-cell memory usage (B/cell)
 
- âœ… Single and multi-agent (player) support
 
- âœ… Modular code with separate grid initialization for each algorithm

## Algorithms

### ðŸŸ¦ Dijkstra-Based Flow Field

- Uses a priority queue to select cells with the lowest cumulative cost.

- Processes each cell once due to sorting.

- Performs well in random terrain, but uses more memory and time than bucket-based methods, making it less ideal.

- Can handle float-based costs directly, as the priority queue supports precise sorting of floating-point numbers.

### ðŸŸ© Bucket-Based Flow Field

- Uses a fixed-size modular queue indexed by cost.

- Processes each cell once due to sorting.

- Highly efficient in both dense and sparse environments.

- **Best overall performance**.

- Requires costs to be discretized into fixed intervals (e.g., integers or floats with a fixed step like `0.2f`) to group cells into buckets for efficient processing.

### ðŸŸ¨ Queue-Based Flow Field

- FIFO queue with in-queue tracking.

- May process each cell more than once due to lack of sorting.

- Fast and memory-light in open fields or sparse environments.

- Simple and easy to implement.

## Example Usage 


You can run benchmarks via static calls like:



```csharp
var (grid, time, loop, mem) = FlowfieldBenchmark.Dijkstra(gridSize, players, walls);
```


Each function returns:

 
- The processed grid
 
- Total time in microseconds

- Loop count (processed nodes)

- Max queue size (if tracked)

## Methodology 


### Movement Costs 

 
- Orthogonal (N/S/E/W): `2 to 5 units`
 
- Diagonal (NW/NE/SW/SE): `3 to 7 units`
 
- Obstacles: `50 units` (treated as high-cost terrain)


### Grid Types 

 
- **No Walls** : Empty, open map
 
- **Concentric Walls** : Square ring barriers with corner gaps
 
- **Random Walls** : 50% density, randomly distributed


### Evaluation 

 
- Execution time recorded using `Stopwatch`
 
- Memory usage estimated per grid cell
 
- No rendering or path reconstruction included
